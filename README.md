# LFSR_LinearFeedbackShiftRegister
A LFSR or Linear Feedback Shift Register is a quick and easy way to generate pseudo-random data inside of an FPGA.  The LFSR can be used for things like counters, test patterns, scrambling of data, and others.  This module creates an LFSR whose width gets set by a parameter.  The o_LFSR_Done will pulse once all combinations of the LFSR are complete.  The number of clock cycles that it takes o_LFSR_Done to pulse is equal to 2^g_Num_Bits-1.  For example setting g_Num_Bits to 5 means that o_LFSR_Done will pulse every 2^5-1 = 31 clock cycles.  o_LFSR_Data will change on each clock cycle that the module is enabled, which can be used if desired.
